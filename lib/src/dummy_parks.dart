            "description": "Lava Beds a land of turmoil, both geological and historical. Over the last half-million years, volcanic eruptions on the Medicine Lake shield volcano have created a rugged landscape dotted with diverse volcanic features. More than 800 caves, Native American rock art sites, historic battlefields and campsites, and a high desert wilderness experience await you! The park can be visited anytime of the day, we just ask that you self screen for white-nose syndrome at the visitor center before entering any caves.",
